# The Rationale Behind: Our FRC Dashboard

by 10tothe6

There are a lot of programs that run on driverstations that can display information from the robot to anyone who happens to be driving it. We all know them as `dashboards`. Here are the most popular ones, from what I've seen:

* `WPILib Shuffleboard`
* `WPILib SmartDashboard`
* `LabVIEW`
* `Glass`
* `AdvantageScope`
* `Elastic`

As you can see, there are a few to choose from (to be fair, not all of these are the kinds of dashboards you would use *during a match*, some are more suited for testing in-house). Which one did we pick? Well, we didn't.

The dashboard that our team uses is called `Drivetools`, and it's developed by `FAR Robotics` (that's a fancy way of saying that it's developed by me, 10tothe6).
