# The Rationale: The How and Why of Our Robot Code

So our robot code has gotten a top-to-bottom revamp, and hopefully a lot of the code that we're using now gets used in years to come.

"The Rationale" is a little blog-thing that aims to explain how our code works and why it works that way, for future team members or people from other teams to read. Basically the idea is, if you ever end up asking "how do I ___?" or "why is this code like this?" then you can just look it up here.

Most of this is written by Maximilian McDiarmid, aka. `10tothe6`, you can reach him at `fullautorobots@gmail.com` if you want to ask anything.
