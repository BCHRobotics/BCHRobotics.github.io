The idea is to take a source image and pick out regions that have a similar color - the color of the game piece we want to look for. {raw image of a game piece} {processed image of a game piece} Setup Photonvision has an entire framework for color banding built into it, so it's incredibly easy to set up. {image showing the panel} This is what the camera sees. By looking for yellow circles in the image, we can detect the ball (the red square is its bounding box). Flaws Since we are only looking for color and no other characteristics like shape, this approach struggles to differentiate between items of the same color - yellow balls vs. yellow cones, for example. This time, the camera can see two yellow objects: a ball and a cone. As you can see, the result is a lot messier. Keep in mind that we're only trying to detect the ball. Worse is when you accidentally detect field elements or other things in the background that have a similar color to the one you want - or just happen to look that way because of the lighting. It gets much worse when the game piece you're looking for is either red or blue (the balls from 2022 is one example) because many field elements are either red or blue. In short, if you're looking for a red or blue game piece you can abandon all hope of using color banding to find it.","title":"Color Banding"},{"location":"g_color-banding/#object-detection-with-color-banding","text":"This is the simpler of the two common approaches to object detection.

Please add to this if you find any more problems/solutions! Robot suddenly drives full-speed in a direction? (CAREFULLY disable and enable again to see if it keeps driving, it should head in the same direction it was going in.) This is caused by a value of NaN or Infinity being sent to the drivetrain. The easiest way to get NaN is using a divide by zero, so check for any divides in the code and make sure you're not allowing zeros to get through. One of the swerve wheels is dragging or spinning in the wrong direction? Possible fixes: reset the swerve turning encoders (see [LINK]) check for any unplugged encoder or power cables (and plug them back in) If the above don't work, make sure nobody has edited the swerve-handling part of the robot code, especially the following: in Constants.java public static final double kFrontLeftChassisAngularOffset = -Math.PI / 2; public static final double kFrontRightChassisAngularOffset = 0; public static final double kBackLeftChassisAngularOffset = Math.PI; public static final double kBackRightChassisAngularOffset = Math.PI / 2; You may want to test the problematic motors on their own to make sure they work. Photonvision isn't responding? Restarting either photonvision or the coprocessor should fix it.
