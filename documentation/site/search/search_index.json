Please add to this if you find any more problems/solutions! Robot suddenly drives full-speed in a direction? (CAREFULLY disable and enable again to see if it keeps driving, it should head in the same direction it was going in.) This is caused by a value of NaN or Infinity being sent to the drivetrain. The easiest way to get NaN is using a divide by zero, so check for any divides in the code and make sure you're not allowing zeros to get through. One of the swerve wheels is dragging or spinning in the wrong direction? Possible fixes: reset the swerve turning encoders (see [LINK]) check for any unplugged encoder or power cables (and plug them back in) If the above don't work, make sure nobody has edited the swerve-handling part of the robot code, especially the following: in Constants.java public static final double kFrontLeftChassisAngularOffset = -Math.PI / 2; public static final double kFrontRightChassisAngularOffset = 0; public static final double kBackLeftChassisAngularOffset = Math.PI; public static final double kBackRightChassisAngularOffset = Math.PI / 2; You may want to test the problematic motors on their own to make sure they work.","title":"List of Known Issues"},{"location":"known-issues/#list-of-known-problems-and-their-solutions","text":"Hopefully this helps with troubleshooting any random issues that come up.
