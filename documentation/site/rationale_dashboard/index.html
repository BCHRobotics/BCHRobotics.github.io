    <h1 id="the-rationale-behind-our-frc-dashboard-drivetools">The Rationale Behind: Our FRC Dashboard (Drivetools)</h1>
<p>by <code>10tothe6</code></p>
<p>There are a lot of programs that run on driverstations that can display information from the robot to anyone who happens to be driving it. We all know them as <code>dashboards</code>. Here are the most popular ones, from what I've seen:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WPILib Shuffleboard</code></li>
<li><code>WPILib SmartDashboard</code></li>
<li><code>LabVIEW</code></li>
<li><code>Glass</code></li>
<li><code>AdvantageScope</code></li>
<li><code>Elastic</code></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are a few to choose from (to be fair, not all of these are the kinds of dashboards you would use <em>during a match</em>, some are more suited for testing in-house). Which one did we pick? Well, we didn't.</p>
<p>The dashboard that our team uses is called <code>Drivetools</code>, and it's developed by <code>FAR Robotics</code> (that's a fancy way of saying that it's developed by me, <code>10tothe6</code>). So add that one to the list, I guess.</p>
<p>Alright so why did I decide to make my own dashboard? First let's look at what I dislike about the existing dashboards.
<em>(I admit that I'm not the most well-informed, feel free to let me know that I'm wrong about some of these)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>LabView</code>: It's... old. And not very easy to work with, from what I've seen.</li>
<li><code>Shuffleboard</code>: It's just not as customizable as I'd like.</li>
<li><code>SmartDashboard</code>: I've never seen it <em>not</em> glitch out, and display the text weirdly. Also old.</li>
<li><code>Glass</code>: Actually I can't think of anything, I guess it's a little busy.</li>
<li><code>AdvantageScope</code>: Never tried it, but I know it doesn't work that well for competition scenarios.</li>
<li><code>Elastic</code>: Best one that I've seen, I don't have any gripes about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously that's not enough, I mean why not just use <code>Elastic</code>? The big reason is that as a part of <code>FAR Robotics</code> I want to do a lot of more advanced things that involve communication from the computer to the robot. It's really useful to have a custom solution for that, which is why we didn't use some <em>other</em> teams custom dashboard.</p>
<p>In the end, it comes down to features. There are a few <em>really</em> specific features that none of the other dashboards have, that <code>Drivetools</code> does. And hey, it's a good opportunity to try and improve on things, right?</p>
<p><em>(I encourage you to try <code>Drivetools</code> by the way, I think its cool)</em></p>
