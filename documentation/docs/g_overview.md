# FRC Robotics Guides and Tutorials
 
The guides and tutorials on this site are divided into loose categories, put in an order that hopefully makes sense. My goal is for this to be the largest one-stop-shop for FRC information that's out there (except maybe the WPILib documentation itself). All of the guides found here are written to be as comprehensive and easy-to-read as possible.
