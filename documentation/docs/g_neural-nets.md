# Object Detection With Neural Networks

This is the more complicated of the two approaches, but is substantially more effective. A deeper understanding of neural networks (than what will be explained on this page) can be found here: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfMk-kjRv4c)

## Training Data


 
## Flaws

*TLDR: the ai can mess up, good data takes work*

It's still possible, especially if you don't have a lot of training data or if your training data is too self-similar, for parts of the image that aren't actually game pieces to be selected just because they have a similar color. Good models take a lot of data, and that can take a while.
