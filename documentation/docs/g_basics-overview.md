# The Basics of FRC Robotics Programming
 
### A note from Maximilian M (aka. 10tothe6), ex-programming lead for the 2386 Trojans:
This subset of guides aims to explain everything you need to do to at least get an FRC robot *running*. I like to think of it as a quick reference of sorts.
 
I won't pretend that this guide is complete - or even that extensive - and I may have forgotten some things. For a *very* extensive guide on setting up an FRC robot, see [this Youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/@0ToAuto). It'll take more time to go through, but I highly recommend it - especially if it's your first time doing anything like this.
 
If you were reading something on this website and had a question about it, for example you thought I worded something weirdly or you think I wrote something wrong, email me at `maximilianmcdiarmid@gmail.com` and I'll try and help. If the question is more about FRC itself, you're better off looking it up on the internet.
