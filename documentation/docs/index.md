# 2386 Trojans Programming Documentation
 
![alt text](img/trojan_title.png?)
 
Welcome! Mostly, there are a bunch of guides here for doing different FRC-related things, from setting up a new robot project to advanced game piece detection algorithms. The hope is that all of this information can serve as a quick reference for any FRC programmer - on the Trojans or otherwise.
 
Hopefully you'll find what you need.
