# Downloading and Installing FRC Software
`in progress`
 
There are three different pieces of software - actually more like bundles of software - that you need to install to work on FRC robot projects: `Git`, `FRC Game Tools`, and `WPILib`.
 
*Note that there are official installation guides for both WPILib ([here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)) and FRC Game Tools ([here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html)). Feel free to use those instead - much like some of the other guides on this site, the only reason I'm writing this is to make sure all information is available in one spot. This guide isn't any better than the offical ones, really.*

## Git
 
You can download git from [here](https://git-scm.com/install/), just click whatever operating system you're running.

Once the *.exe* installer is downloaded, just double-click it and click through the installation wizard. That's it, you now have Git installed.
